# Introduction

Finding a species in a certain location is like finding an encrypted message
that traveled through time. It carries the species’ evolutionary history,
migration patterns, as well as any direct and indirect effects generated by
other species (some of which we may not even know exist). Ecologists have been
trying to decode this message with progressively more powerful tools, from their
field notes to highly complex computational algorithms. However, to succeed
in this challenge it is important to have the right clues in hand. There are
many ways we can be misled by data - or the lack of it: taxonomic errors (e.g.,
due to updates in the taxonomy of a species), geographic inaccuracy (e.g.,
approximate coordinates or lack of documentation about their accuracy), or
sampling biases (e.g. data clustered near roads or research centers)
[@Ladle2013MapSpe; @Hortal2015SevSho; @Poisot2021GloKno]. One way to identify -
and potentially fix - these errors is
to combine many different pieces of information about the occurrence of a
species, so agreements and mismatches can emerge. Although previous studies have
combined different types of occurrence data to measure the accuracy of datasets
[@Hurlbert2007SpeRic; @Hurlbert2005DisRan; @Ficetola2014EvaRob], none have used
different types of information so far (i.e., ecological characteristics other
than geographical distribution). Here we suggest jointly analysing species
occurrence (range maps and point occurrences) and ecological interactions to
identify mismatches between datasets.  

Interactions form complex networks that shape ecological structures and maintain
the essential functions of ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, and
biological control [@Albrecht2018PlaAni; @Fricke2022EffDef] that ultimately
affect the composition, richness, and successional patterns of communities
across biomes. Yet, the connection between occurrence and interaction data is a
frequent debate in ecology [@Blanchet2020CooNot; Wisz2013RolBio]. For instance,
macroecological models are often used with point or range occurrence data in
order to investigate the dynamics of a species with its environment. However,
these models do not account for ecological interactions, although it has been demonstrated that they might largely
affect species distribution [@Abrego2021AccSpe; @Afkhami2014MutEff;
@Araujo2014ImpBio; @Godsoe2017IntBio; @Godsoe2012HowSpe; @Gotelli2010MacSig;
Wisz2013RolBio]. Some researchers argue that occurrence data can also capture
real-time interactions [see @Roy2016FocPla; @Ryan2018RolCit], and, because of that,
it would not be necessary to include ecological interaction dynamics in
macroecological models. On the other hand, many mechanistic simulation models in
ecology have considered the effect of competition and facilitation in range
shifts. For example, Gotelli _et al._ -[@Gotelli2010MacSig] demonstrate how
conspecific attraction might be the main factor driving the distribution of
migratory birds; Afkhami _et al._ -[@Afkhami2014MutEff] explores how mutualistic
fungal endophytes are responsible or expanding the range of native grass; many
other examples are discussed in Wisz _et al._ -[@Wisz2013RolBio]. Although
interactions across trophic levels are demonstrated to determine species range
[@Wisz2013RolBio], the use of these interactions in mechanistic simulation
models in macroecology remains insufficient [as discussed in @Cabral2017MecSim]. 

A significant challenge in this debate is the quality and quantity of species
distribution and ecological data [@Boakes2010DisVie; @Ronquillo2020AssSpa;
@Meyer2016MulBia] - a gap that can lead to erroneous conclusions in
macroecological research [@Hortal2008HisBia]. Amongst the geographical data
available are the range maps provided by the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Such maps consist of simplified polygons, often
created as alpha or convex hulls around known species locations, refined by
expert knowledge about the species [@IUCN2019MapSta].
These maps can be used in macroecological inferences in the lack of more precise
information [@Fourcade2016ComSpe; @Alhajeri2019HigCor], but it has been
recommended that they are used with caution since they tend to underestimate the
distribution of species that are not well-known [@Herkt2017MacCon] (especially
at fine scale resolutions; [@Hurlbert2007SpeRic; @Hurlbert2005DisRan]), do not
represent spatial variation in species occurrence and abundance
[@Dallas2020AbuNot], and can include inadequate areas within the estimated
range. Another source of species distribution information is the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is an online repository of
georeferenced observational records that come from various sources, including
community science programs, museum collections, and long-term monitoring
schemes. A great source of bias in these datasets is the irregular sampling
effort, with more occurrences originating from attractive and accessible areas
and observation of charismatic species [@Alhajeri2019HigCor]. As for ecological
data, a complete assessment is difficult and is aggravated by biased sampling
methods and data aggregation [@Poisot2020EnvBia; @Hortal2015SevSho].
Nevertheless, we have witnessed an increase in the availability of biodiversity
data in the last decades, including those collected through community science
projects [@Callaghan2019ImpBig; @Pocock2015BioRec] and dedicated
databases, such as Mangal [@Poisot2016ManMak]. This provides an opportunity to
merge species distribution and ecological interaction data to improve our
predictions of where a species may be found across large spatial scales (e.g.,
continental and global). 

It has been demonstrated that the agreement between range maps and point data
varies geographically [@Hurlbert2007SpeRic; @Hurlbert2005DisRan;
@Ficetola2014EvaRob]. Adding ecological interaction data to this comparison
might help to elucidate where these (dis)agreements are more likely to be true
and which dataset better represent the actual distribution of species. In this
context, we elaborate a method that allows us to refine distribution
data (more precisely range maps) based on interaction data, considering the
basic assumption that predators can only be present in regions where they are
connected to at least one herbivore - and thus indirectly connected to primary
producers. We used a Serengeti food web dataset [@Baskerville2011SpaGui] (which
comprises carnivores, herbivores, and plants from Tanzania) to demonstrate how a
mismatch between occurrence and interaction data can highlight significant
uncertainty areas in IUCN range maps. Finally, we add the GBIF occurrence points
for the Serengeti species to the investigation, discuss the mechanisms that can
lead to the lack of agreement between data, and build from that a vision for the
next steps, reinforcing the importance of geographically explicit interaction
data.  


# Methods

Organisms cannot persist unless they are directly or indirectly connected to a
primary producer within their associated food web [@Power1992TopBot]. Therefore,
the range of a predator (omnivore or carnivore) depends on the overlapping
ranges of its preys. If sections of a predator's range does not overlap with at
least one of its prey it will become disconnected from primary producers, and
therefore we would not expect the predator to occur in this area. This mismatch
can be the result of different mechanisms, like the misestimation of both the predator's and the preys' ranges [@Ladle2013MapSpe; Rondinini2006TraDif], taxonomic errors
[@Isaac2004TaxInf; @Ladle2013MapSpe], or the lack of information about trophic
links (i.e., the lack of connection between the ranges of a predator and a
primary producer may be due a third species we don't know is connected to both).
Thus, given that herbivores are the main connection between plant resources
(directly limited by environmental conditions) and predators [@Dobson2009FooStr;
@Scott2018RolHer], here we adjusted the ranges of predators based on a simple
rule: we removed any part of a predator’s range that did not intersect with the
range of at least one prey herbivore species. So, unless the range of the
predator overlapped with at least one prey item, which in turn is directly
connected to a primary producer (plants), we removed that section of the
predator’s range. Finally, we calculated the difference in range size between
the original IUCN ranges and those adjusted based on species interaction data.

## Data 

We investigated the mismatch between savannah species ranges and interactions in
Africa (@fig:richness). These ecosystems host a range of
different species, including the well-characterized predator-prey dynamics
between iconic predators (e.g., lions, hyenas, and leopards) and large herbivores
(e.g., antelopes, wildebeests, and zebras), as well as a range of herbivorous and
carnivorous small mammals. The Serengeti ecosystem has been extensively studied
and its food web is one of the most complete we have to date, including primary
producers identified to the species level. Here we focus on six groups of
herbivores and carnivores from the Serengeti Food Web Data Set
[@Baskerville2011SpaGui]. These species exhibit direct antagonistic
(predator-prey) interactions with one another and are commonly found across
savannah ecosystems on the African continent [@McNaughton1992ProDis]. Plants in
the network were included indirectly in our analyses as we do not expect the
primary producers to significantly influence the range of herbivores for several
reasons. Firstly, many savannah plants are functionally similar (i.e., grasses,
trees and shrubs) and cooccur across the same habitats [@Baskerville2011SpaGui].
Secondly, herbivores in the network are broadly generalists feeding on a wide
range of different plants across habitats. Indeed, out of 129 plants in our dataset,
herbivores (n = 23) had a mean out degree (mean number of preys) of around 22 (std = 17.5).
There is also an absence of global range maps for many plant species
[@Daru2020GreToo], which prevents their direct inclusion in our analysis. Therefore, we
assume that plants consumed by herbivores are present across their ranges, and
as such the ranges of herbivores are not expected to be significantly
constrained by the availability of food plants.  

From the wider ecological network presented in Baskerville
[-@Baskerville2011SpaGui], we sampled interaction data for herbivores and
carnivores. This subnetwork contained 32 taxa (23 herbivores and 9 carnivores)
and 84 interactions and had a connectance of 0.08. Although self-loops are
informative, we removed these interactions to allow for the original IUCN
ranges of predators with cannibalistic interactions to be adjusted. We treated 
this overall network as a metaweb since it *should* contain all potential species
interactions between mammalian taxa occurring across savannah
ecosystems such as the Serengeti.  

We compiled IUCN range maps for the 32 species included in the metaweb from the
Spatial Data Download portal
(www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download), which we rasterized at 10
arc-minute resolution (~19 km² at the equator). We then combined interaction
data from the metaweb and cooccurrence data generated from species ranges to
create networks for each raster pixel. This generated a total of 84,244
pixel-level networks. These networks describe potential predation, not actual
interactions: the former is derived information from the metaweb, and the latter
is contingent on the presence of herbivores. 

## Range overlap measurement 

We calculated the geographical overlap, i.e. the extent to which interacting predator
and prey species co-occurred across their ranges, as 
<!---, by using a method presented by Ruggiero, Lawton, and Blackburn [-@Ruggiero1998GeoRan]--->
$a/(a + c)$, where $a$ is the number of pixels where predator and prey cooccur and $c$ 
is the number of pixels where only the focal species occur. This index of geographical
overlap can be
calculated with prey or predators as the focal species. Values vary between 0
and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating that there is a large overlap in the
ranges of the two species and values closer to 0 indicating low cooccurrence
across their ranges. For each predator species, we calculated its generality to
understand whether the level of trophic specialization (i.e., number of prey
items per predator) affects the extent to which the ranges of the species were
altered. One would assume that predators with a greater number of prey taxa
(i.e., a higher generality) are less likely to have significant changes in their range
as it is more likely that at least one prey species is present across most of their
range.   

## Validation

For each species in the dataset we collated point observation data from GBIF 
(www.gbif.org), and condensed these data into pixels representing presence or
absence of the focal taxon. These data were used to validate the range 
adjustments made based on species interactions (see the previous section). To do
so, we calculated the proportion of GBIF presence pixels occurring within both
the original and adjusted species ranges. We then compared these proportions
for the predators to verify if the range adjustments removed locations with GBIF
observations, hence likely true habitats.

# Results

Mammal species found in the Serengeti food web are widespread in Africa,
especially in grasslands and savannahs (first panel of @fig:richness). However,
most local networks (83.2%) built using the original IUCN range maps had at
least one mammal species without a path to a primary producer (second panel of
@fig:richness). On average, local food webs had almost the third of their mammal
species (mean = 30.5%, median = 14.3%) disconnected from basal species. In
addition, many networks (16.6%) only had disconnected mammals; these networks
however all had a very low number of mammal species, specifically between 1 and
4 (from a total of 32). As expected, the proportion of carnivores with a path to a
primary producer was conditional on the total number of mammal species in each local
network (third panel of @fig:richness).

## Specialized predators lose more range

![Negative relationship between the out degree of predator species and their
relative range loss. More specialized predators lose a higher proportion of
their ranges due to mismatches with the ranges of their
preys.](figures/rel_loss-outdegree-species.png){#fig:degree}

Predators with fewer prey lose more range with our method ([@fig:degree]). For
instance, both *Leptailurus serval* and *Canis mesomelas* have only one prey in
the Serengeti food web ([@tbl:everyone]), each of them with a very small range
compared to those of their predator. This discrepancy between range sizes
promotes significant range loss. On the other hand, predators of the genus
*Panthera* are some of the most connected species, and they also lose the least
proportion of their ranges. This mismatch between predators and preys can also
be a result of taxonomic disagreement between the geographical and ecological
data. Although *Canis aureus* has the same number of prey as *Caracal caracal*,
none of the prey taxa of the former occurs inside its original range
([@tbl:everyone]), which results in complete range loss. 

![Geographical similarity between the original IUCN range maps of predators
and preys. Dots represent predator-prey pairs, with different symbols
corresponding to different predators. For a given pair of species, the number
$c$ of pixels where the focal species is present but not the other and the number $a$ of pixels
where the predator and prey cooccur, were calculated.
Geographic similarities were given by $a/(a+c)$, with the predator being the
focal species in the predator to prey similarity (x-axis), while the prey is
the focal one in the prey to predator similarity (y-axis). One of the
predators, *Canis aureus*, is not represented in the image because it is an
extreme case (where all its range is suppressed by the absence of preys) and it
would make the interpretation of the data more
difficult.](figures/beta-div_pred-species.png){#fig:geo_diss} 

There was a high variation in the overlap of predator and prey ranges
(@fig:geo_diss). The high density of points on the left-hand side of @fig:geo_diss
indicates that most preys have small ranges in comparison to those of the set of
carnivores in the networks, resulting in either low overlap between both ranges
(bottom) or high overlap of ranges because much of that of the prey is within
predators' range (top). The top-right side of the plot encompasses situations where
the ranges of both predator and prey are similar and overlapping, while the 
bottom-right part of the plot represents a situation where the range of the predator
is smaller than that of its prey and much of it occurs within the preys' range.
For example, *Panthera
pardus* had many preys occurring inside its range, with highly variable levels of overlap
([@tbl:everyone]). In general, species exhibited more consistent values of
prey-predator overlap, than predator-prey overlap – indicated by the spread of
points along the x-axis, yet more restricted variation on the y-axis
(@fig:geo_diss). There was also no overall relationship between the two metrics,
or for any predator species.

(*Loxodonta africana*) and how *Canis aureus*'s range does not overlap with any of
its preys. {#tbl:everyone}

## Validation with GBIF occurrences

The proportion of GBIF pixels (pixels with at least one GBIF occurrence) falling
in the IUCN ranges varied from low to high depending on the species
([@fig:gbif], left). The lowest proportions occurred for species with small
ranges (such as *Lycaon pictus*), although some species with small ranges showed
high overlap. Species with median and large ranges had high proportions of
occurrences falling into their IUCN range. Predators and preys displayed similar
overlap variations. While no species had all of its GBIF occurrences within its
IUCN range, one species had this proportion equal to zero, _Canis aureus_, which
is also the only species whose range is not covered by any of its preys. This
result reinforces the concern raised in the literature on the use of IUCN range
maps for species that are not well known [@Herkt2017MacCon], demonstrating how
small range species are likely to have their distribution underestimated in the
IUCN database. Additionally, the fact that _Canis aureus_ had none of its GBIF
pixels overlapping with IUCN maps suggests a taxonomic mismatch between both
databases, which we explore in the Discussion section. 

The proportion of GBIF pixels in updated ranges can only be equal to or lower
than that of the original ranges, as our analysis removes pixels from the
original range and does not add new ones. Rather, the absence of a difference
between the two types of ranges indicates that no pixels with GBIF observations,
hence likely true habitats, were removed by our analysis. Here this proportion
was mostly similar to that of the original IUCN ranges for most predator species
([@fig:gbif, right]). Four species showed no difference in proportion while
three species showed only small differences (proportions of 0.01 to 0.05). On
the other hand, two species, _Canis mesomelas_, and _Leptailurus serval_ showed
very high differences, with overlaps lower by 0.548 and 0.871 respectively. For
_Leptailurus serval_, none of the GBIF observations occurred in the updated
range. These two species are also the only predators with a single prey in our
metaweb. Our results delineate how a mismatch between GBIF and IUCN databases
differ greatly with small changes in herbivore species ranges, and it is
somewhat positively related to range size for predator species. Moreover, we
show that accounting for interactions does not necessarily aggravates this
dissimilarity, but it is relevant for species with little ecological information
or specialists.

# Discussion

The jackal is a widespread taxon in northern Africa, Europe, and Australasia,
generally well adapted to local conditions due to its largely varied diet
[@Tsunoda2020VarTro; @Krofel2021ResTax]. Because of that, we expected that the
_Canis_ species in our dataset would be the ones losing the least amount of
range, with a higher value of the proportion of GBIF pixels within their IUCN range
maps. However, the taxonomy of this group is a matter of intense discussion, as
molecular and morphological data seem to disagree in the clustering of species
and subspecies [@Krofel2021ResTax; @Stoyanov2020CraVar]. This debate is indeed
reflected in our analysis: the GBIF identification of the golden jackal is
incompatible with the one used by IUCN, each of them mapping its distribution in
completely different places. This led to a complete exclusion of *Canis aureus*
from its original range in our analysis, despite the fact that this species has
four documented preys in our metaweb. This example illustrates how the
taxonomic, geographical and ecological data can be used to validate one another. 

Here we show that when ecological interaction data (predator-prey interactions
within food webs) are used to refine species range maps, there are significant
reductions in the IUCN range size of predatory organisms. Despite showing the
potential importance of accounting for species interactions when estimating the
range of a species, it remains unclear the extent to which the patterns observed
represent ecological processes or a lack of data.

## Connectivity, diversity and range preservation

In the Serengeti food web, there is a positive relationship between the out
degrees of predators and the size of their ranges. In
addition, there is a negative relationship between the
relative loss of predators' ranges and their number of preys,
reinforcing the idea that generalist species can preserve their distributions
longer while losing interactions. The factors limiting the geographical range of
a species in a community can vary with connectivity and richness
[@Svenning2014InfInt]. Younger communities may be more affected by environmental
limitations because they are dominated by generalist species, while older
metacommunities are probably affected in different ways in the center of the
distribution, at the edge of ranges, and in sink and source communities
[@Svenning2014InfInt; @Godsoe2017IntBio; @Cazelles2016IntBio;
@Bullock2000GeoSep]. Additionally, it is likely that species with larger ranges
of distribution and those that are more generalists would co-occur with a
greater number of other species [@Dattilo2020SpeDri], while dispersal capacity
of competitive species modulate their aggregation in space and the effect of
interactions on their range limits [@Godsoe2017IntBio].

## Geographical mismatch and data availability

The geographical mismatch between predators and preys has ecological
consequences such as loss of ecosystem functioning and extinction of populations
[@Anderson2016SpaDis; @Dattilo2018EcoNet; @Pringle2016LarHer; @Young2013EffMam].
Climate change is one of the causes of this, leading, for instance, to the
decrease of plant populations due to the lack of pollination [@Bullock2000GeoSep;
@Afkhami2014MutEff; @Godsoe2017IntBio]. However, this mismatch can also be
purely informational. When the distribution of predators and preys does not
superpose, it can mean we lack information about the distribution of either
species or about their interactions (e.g., predators may be feeding on different
species than the ones in our dataset outside the Serengeti ecosystem). Here we
addressed part of this problem by comparing the IUCN range maps with GBIF
occurrences, which helped us clarify what is the shortfall for each species. 

The lack of superposition between IUCN range maps and GBIF occurrences suggests
that we certainly do miss geographical information about the distribution of a
certain species, but it is not an indicator of the completeness of the
information about ecological interactions. However, if both GBIF and IUCN
occurrences tend to superpose and still the species is locally removed, this
indicates we don't have information about all its interactions. The combination
of this rationale with our method of updating range maps based on ecological
interactions allows us to have a clearer idea of which information we are
missing. For example, the lion (*Panthera leo*) was one of the species with the
smallest difference between the original and the updated ranges (@fig:degree),
but 59.5% of the GBIF occurrences for this species fell outside the IUCN range. In this particular case, the IUCN maps seem to agree with species
interaction data. However, the disagreement between the IUCN and the GBIF
databases is concerning and suggests that the IUCN maps might underestimate the
lion's distribution. On the other hand, *Leptailurus serval* and *Canis
mesomelas* are two of the three species that lose the higher proportion of range
due to the lack of paths to a herbivore (@fig:degree), but are also some of the
species with the higher proportion of GBIF occurrences inside IUCN range maps. This indicates that the information we are missing for these two
species is related to either the occurrence of an interaction or the presence of
interacting species. To illustrate that, we mapped the GBIF data for the prey of
*Leptailurus serval*, with a mobility buffer around each point ([@fig:serval]).
When considering GBIF data, approximately 53% of the prey's occurrences are
within the portion of the serval's range that was lost. With the buffer area,
this corresponds to 13% of the lost range. This means that by adding GBIF
information, we would reduce the loss of range (or information) for the predator
by 13% since its distribution is conditional on the occurrence of its preys.

![Mismatch between serval's range loss and GBIF occurrence of its prey. The
left panel shows the reduction of serval's range when we consider the IUCN data
on its prey. On the right panel, we added GBIF data on both serval and its prey,
with a buffer for the prey to account for species mobility.](figures/serval_mismatch_combined.png){#fig:serval}

Finally, the extreme case of *Canis aureus* illustrates a lack of both
geographical and ecological information: none of its GBIF occurrences and none
of its preys occur inside its IUCN range. We believe, therefore, that the
validation of species distribution based on ecological interaction is a relevant
method that can further fill in information gaps. Nevertheless, it is imperative
that more geographically explicit data about ecological networks and
interactions become available. This would help clarify when cooccurrences can be
translated into interactions and help the development of more advanced
validation methods for occurrence data.  

## Next steps

Here we demonstrated how we can detect uncertainty in species distribution data
using ecological interactions. Knowing where questionable occurrence data are can
be crucial in ecological modelling [@Hortal2008UncMea; @Ladle2013MapSpe], and
accounting for these errors can improve model outputs by diminishing the error
propagation [@Draper1995AssPro]. For instance, we believe this is a way to
account for ecological interactions in habitat suitability models without making
the models more complex, but by making sure (not assuming) that the input data -
the species occurrence - actually accounts for ecological interactions. It is
important to notice, however, that the quality and usefulness of this method are
highly correlated with the amount and quality of data available about species'
occurrences **and** interactions. With this paper, we hope to add to the
collective effort to decode the encrypted message that is the occurrence of a
species in space and time. A promising avenue that adds to our method is the
prediction of networks and interactions in large scales [@Strydom2021RoaPre],
for they can add valuable information about ecological interactions where they
are missing. Additionally, in order to achieve a robust modelling framework
towards actual species distribution models we should invest in efforts to
collect and combine open data on species occurrence and interactions, especially
because we may be losing ecological interactions at least as fast as we are
losing species [@Valiente-Banuet2015SpeLos].
