# Introduction

Finding a species in a certain location is like finding an encrypted message
that travelled through time. This message carries the species’ evolutionary
history, migration patterns, as well as any direct and indirect effects
generated by other species (some of which we may not even know exist).
Ecologists have been trying to decode this message with progressively more
powerful tools, from their own field notes to highly complex computational
algorithms. These methods attempt to describe the species’ distribution based on
their niche, considering their occurrences as sample points of suitable abiotic
variables and their absences as sample points of unsuitable variables
[@Peterson2012EcoNic]. Therefore, it has become possible to understand the
factors influencing the macroecology of organisms at large spatial scales. But
one part of this puzzle remains missing: how do ecological interactions shape
species distribution range? 

Interactions form complex networks that shape ecological structures and maintain
the essential functions of ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, and
biological control [@Albrecht2018PlaAni; @Fricke2022EffDef] that ultimately
affects the composition, richness, and successional patterns of communities
across biomes. Yet, the connection between occurrence and interaction data is a
frequent debate in Ecology [@Blanchet2020CooNot]. For instance, macroecological
models are often used with point or range occurrence data in order to
investigate the dynamics of a species with its environment. However, these
models do not account for ecological interactions, which might largely affect
species distribution [@AbregoAccSpe; @Afkhami2014MutEff; @Araujo2014ImpBio;
@Godsoe2017IntBio; Godsoe2012HowSpe]. Some researchers argue that occurrence
data can also capture real-time interactions [@Roy2016FocPla; @Ryan2018RolCit],
and, because of that, it would not be necessary to include ecological
interaction dynamics in macroecological models. On the other hand, many
mechanistic simulation models in ecology have considered the effect of
competition and facilitation in range shifts, whilst the use of trophic
interactions in this context remains insufficient [@Cabral2017MecSim]. 

A significant challenge in this debate is the quality and quantity of species
distribution and ecological data [@Boakes2010DisVie; @Ronquillo2020AssSpa;
@Meyer2016MulBia] - a gap that can lead to erroneus conclusions in
macroecological research [@Hortal2008HisBia]. Amongst the geographical data
available are the range maps provided by the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Such maps consist of simplified polygons, often
created as alpha or convex hulls around known species locations, refined by
expert knowledge of species [@IUCNSSCRedListTechnicalWorkingGroup2021MapSta].
These maps can be used in macroecological inferences in the lack of more precise
information [@Fourcade2016ComSpe; @Alhajeri2019HigCor], but it has been
recommended that they are used with caution since they tend to underestimate the
distribution of species that are not well-known [@Herkt2017MacCon], do not
represent spatial variation in species occurrence and abundance
[@Dallas2020AbuNot], and can include inadequate areas within the estimated
range. Another source of species distribution information is the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is an online repository of
georeferenced observational records that comes from various sources, including
community science programs, museum collections, and long-term monitoring
schemes. A great source of bias in these datasets is the irregular sampling
effort, with more occurrences originated from attractive and accessible areas
and observation of charismatic species [@Alhajeri2019HigCor]. As for ecological
data, a complete assessment is difficult and is aggravated by biased sampling
methods and data aggregation [@Poisot2020EnvBia; @Hortal2015SevSho].
Nevertheless, we have witnessed an increase in the availability of biodiversity
data in the last decades, including those collected through community science
projects [@Callaghan2019ImpBig; @Pocock2015BioRec] and organized dedicated
databases, such as mangal [@Poisot2016ManMak]. This provides an opportunity to
merge species distribution and ecological interaction data to improve our
predictions of where a species may be found across large spatial scales (e.g.,
continental and global). 

Herbivores are core study groups for distribution models since they are the main
connection between the plant resources (directly limited by environmental
conditions) and predators [@Dobson2009FooStr; @Scott2018RolHer]. Consequently,
the presence of herbivores could represent the presence of both plant resources
and potential predators. Here we used a Serengeti food web dataset
[@Baskerville2011SpaGui] (which comprises carnivores, herbivores, and plants
from Tanzania) to investigate whether occurrence data (more precisely range
maps) can be refined based on species interaction information. Considering the
basic assumption that predators can only be present in regions where they are
connected to at least one herbivore, and thus decoupled from primary producers,
we demonstrate how a mismatch between occurrence and ecological data can highlight
significant uncertainty areas in range maps. 


# Methods

Organisms cannot persist unless they are directly or indirectly connected to a
primary producer within their associated food web [@Power1992TopBot]. As such,
the range of a predator (omnivore or carnivore) is explained by the overlapping
ranges of its prey. If sections of a predator's range does not overlap with at
least one of its prey it will become disconnected from primary producers, and we
therefore would not expect the predator to occur in this area. This mismatch can
be the result of different mechanisms, such as the overestimation of predator's
range, taxonomic errors, or the lack of information about trophic links. Thus,
here we adjusted the ranges of predators based on a simple rule: we removed any
part of a predator’s range that did not intersect with the range of at least one
prey herbivore species. So, unless the range of the predator overlapped with at
least one prey item, which in turn is directly connected to a primary producer
(plants), we removed that section of the predator’s range. We then calculated
the difference in range size between the original IUCN ranges and those adjusted
based on species interaction data.

## Data 
We investigated the mismatch between species ranges and interactions across 
savannah ecosystems in Africa (@fig:richness). These
ecosystems host a range of different species, including the well characterized
predator-prey dynamics between iconic predators (e.g., lions, hyenas and
leopards) and large herbivores (e.g., antelope, wildebeest and zebra), as well
as a range of herbivorous and carnivorous small mammals. The Serengeti ecosystem has been extensively studied and its
food web is one of the most complete we have to date, including primary producers
identified to the species level. Here we focus on six
groups of herbivores and carnivores from the Serengeti Food Web Data Set
[@Baskerville2011SpaGui]. These species exhibit direct antagonistic
(predator-prey) interactions with one another and are commonly found across
savannah ecosystems on the African continent [@McNaughton1992ProDis]. Plants in the
network were included indirectly in our analyses as we do not expect the primary producers
to significantly influence the range of herbivores for several reasons. Firstly, 
many savannah plants are functionally similar (i.e., grasses, trees and shrubs) and 
cooccur across the same habitats [@Baskerville2011SpaGui]. Secondly, herbivores
in the network are broadly generalists feeding on a wide range of different plants
across habitats <!---MEAN PLANTS PER HERBIVORE--->. There is also an absence of global
range maps for many plant species [@Daru2020GreToo], which also
prevents their direct inclusion. Therefore, we assume that
plants consumed by herbivores are present across
their ranges, and as such the ranges of herbivores are not expected to be
significantly constrained by the availability of food plants.  

From the wider ecological network presented in Baskerville
[-@Baskerville2011SpaGui], we sampled interaction data for herbivores and
carnivores. This subnetwork contained 32 taxa (23 herbivores and 9 carnivores) 
and 84 interactions, and had a connectance of 0.08. Although self-loops are 
informative, here we removed these interactions to allow for the original IUCN ranges of predators
with cannibalistic interactions to be adjusted. We refer to this
overall network as the metaweb as it contains all possible species interactions
between the different taxa that could occur across savannah ecosystems
such as the Serengeti.  

We compile IUCN range maps for the 32 species included in the metaweb from the
Spatial Data Download portal
(www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download), which we rasterized at 10
arc minute resolution (~19 km² at the equator). We then combined interaction
data from the metaweb and cooccurrence data generated from species ranges to
create networks for each raster pixel. This generated a total of 84,244
pixel-level networks. These networks describe potential predation, not actual
interactions: the former is derived information from the metaweb, and the later
is contingent to the presence of herbivores. 

## Range overlap measurement 
We calculated the geographical overlap, the extent to which interacting predator and
prey species cooccurred across their ranges as <!---, by using a method presented by Ruggiero, Lawton, and Blackburn [-@Ruggiero1998GeoRan]--->: *a/(a + c)*. We define *a* 
as the number of pixels where the focal species occurs without another species 
and *c* as the number of pixels where the focal species and another species cooccur.
This index of geographical overlap can be calculated with prey or predators as the 
focal species. Values vary between 0 and 1, with values closer to 0 indicating 
that there is large overlap in the ranges of the two species and values closer to
1 indicate low cooccurrence across their ranges. For each predator species we 
calculated its generality to understand whether the level of trophic specialization
(i.e., number of prey items per predator) affects the extent to which the ranges 
of the species were altered. One would assume that predators with a greater number
of prey taxa (i.e., a higher generality) are less likely to have significant 
changes in range as it is more likely that at least one prey species is present
across its entire range.   

## Validation
For each species in the dataset we collated point observation data from the Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org), and condensed these data into
pixels representing presence or absence of the focal taxon. These data were used to 
validate the range adjustments made based on species interactions (see previous section).
To do so, we calculated the proportion of GBIF pixels occurring within
both the original and adjusted species ranges, standardized by the
total number of pixels within each range to account for variability in range size
between different species.


# Results

Mammal species found in the Serengeti food web are widespread in Africa,
especially in grasslands and Savannahs (left panel of @fig:richness). However,
most local networks (83.2%) built using the original IUCN range maps had at
least one mammal species without a path to a primary producer (right panel of
@fig:richness). On average, local food webs had almost the third of their mammal
species (mean = 30.5%, median = 14.3%) disconnected from basal species. In
addition, many networks (16.6%) only had disconnected mammals; these networks
however all had a very low number of mammal species, specifically between 1 and
4 (from a total of 32).

## Specialized predators lose more range

![Negative relationship between the out degree of predator species and their
relative range loss. More specialized predators lose a higher proportion of
their ranges due to mismatches with the ranges of their preys.](figures/rel_loss-outdegree-species.png){#fig:degree}

Predators with less preys lose more range with our method ([@fig:degree]). For
instance, both *Leptailurus serval* and *Canis mesomelas* have only one prey in
the Serengeti food web ([@tbl:everyone]), each of them with a very small range 
compared to those of their predators. This discrepancy between range sizes promotes
significant range loss. On the other hand, predators of the genus *Panthera* are
some of the most connected species, and they also lose the least proportion of 
their ranges. This mismatch between predators and preys can also be a result of
taxonomic disagreement between the geographical and ecological data. Although 
*Canis aureus* has the same number of prey as *Caracal caracal*, none of the 
prey taxa of the former occurs inside its original range ([@tbl:everyone]), which
results in complete range loss.

$c$ of pixels where the predator and prey cooccur and the number $a$ of pixels
where the focal species is present but not the other, were calculated. Geographic
dissimilarities were given by a/(a+c), with the predator being the focal species
in the predator to prey dissimilarity (x-axis), while the prey is the focal one
in the prey to predator dissimilarity (y-axis). One of the predators, *Canis
aurea*, is not represented in the image because it's an extreme case (where all
its range is suppressed by the absence of preys) and it would make the
interpretation of the data more
difficult.](figures/beta-div_pred-species.png){#fig:geo_diss} 

There was high variation in the overlap of predator and prey ranges
(@fig:geo_diss). The range of several predators were well covered by preys (low
values of both prey-predator and predator-prey geographic dissimilarity values),
yet the ranges of some predators and preys were completely asynchronous, with no
overlap (values of 1 for both overlap metrics; @fig:geo_diss). For example, the
range of *Canis aureus* is not covered by any prey species, whereas *Panthera
pardus* exhibited highly variable levels of overlap with prey taxa ([@tbl:everyone]).
In general, species exhibited more consistent values of prey-predator overlap,
than predator-prey overlap – indicated by the spread of points along the x-axis,
yet more restricted variation on the y axis (@fig:geo_diss). There was also
no overall relationship between the two metrics, or for any predator species.

## Validation with GBIF occurrences

The proportion of GBIF pixels (pixels with at least one GBIF occurrence) falling
in the IUCN ranges varied from low to high depending on the species ([@fig:gbif],
left). The 
lowest proportions occurred for species with small ranges (such as *Lycaon pictus*), although some 
species with small ranges showed high overlap. Species with median and large
ranges had high proportions of occurrences falling into their IUCN range. 
Predators and preys displayed similar overlap variations. While no species had all of its GBIF occurrences within its IUCN range, one species had this proportion equal to zero, _Canis aureus_, which is also
the only species whose range is not covered by any of its preys.
This result reinforces the concern raised in the literature on the use of IUCN
range maps for species that are not well known [@Herkt2017MacCon], demonstrating
how small range species are likely to have their distribution underestimated in
the IUCN database. Additionally, the fact that _Canis aureus_ had none of its
GBIF pixels overlapping with IUCN maps suggests a taxonomic mismatch between
both databases, which we explore in the Discussion section. 

The proportion of GBIF pixels in 
updated ranges can only be equal to or lower than that of the original ranges, as our analysis removes pixels
from the original range and does not add new ones. Rather, the absence of
a difference between the two types of ranges indicates that no pixels with
GBIF observations, hence likely true habitats, were removed by our analysis. Here this proportion was mostly similar to that of the original IUCN ranges
for most predator species ([@fig:gbif, right]). 
Four species showed no difference of proportion while three species showed
only small differences (proportions of 0.01 to 0.05). On the other hand,
two species, _Canis mesomelas_ and _Leptailurus serval_, showed very high
differences, with overlaps lower by 0.548 and 0.871 respectively. For
_Leptailurus serval_, none of the GBIF observations occurred in the 
updated range. These two species are also the only predators with a 
single prey in our metaweb. Our results delineates how a mismatch between GBIF
and IUCN databases differ greatly with small changes in herbivore species
ranges, and it is somewhat positively related to range size for predator
species. Moreover, we show that accounting for interactions does not necessarily
aggravates this dissimilarity, but it is relevant for species with little
ecological information or specialists.

# Discussion

In our case, one predator (*Canis aureus*)
would be completely excluded of its original range probably because of a
taxonomic mismatch between datasets, which is hard to solve based only on 
occurrence data. Hence, this method can be useful when the study group
is well known, and the growing availability of data will certainly
improve its applicability.

Here we lend further evidence to the debate surrounding the effects of ecological
interactions on the distribution and abundance of species at large scales 
[@Bullock2000GeoSep; @Chesson2008IntPre; @Godsoe2012HowSpe; @Svenning2014InfInt;
@Godsoe2017IntBio; Pearson2003PreImp; @Soberon2009NicDis]. We show that when ecological 
interaction data (predator-prey interactions within food webs) are used to 
refine species range maps, there are significant reductions in the IUCN
range size of predatory organisms. Despite showing the potential importance
in accounting for species interactions when estimating the range of a species,
it remains unclear the extent to which the patterns observed represent
ecological processes or a lack of data. In the following sections we discuss
the implications of our findings, in terms of species range maps, interaction
data and the next steps required to enhance understanding of species 
distributions using information on ecological networks.

## Connectivity, diversity and range preservation

In the Serengeti food web there is a positive relationship between the out degrees of 
predators and the size of their ranges ([@tbl:everyone]). In addition, our
results show that there is a negative relationship between the relative loss of
range and number of preys ([@fig:degree]), reinforcing the idea that generalist
species tend to preserve their range. The factors limiting the geographical
range of a species in a community can vary with connectivity and richness.
Younger communities may be more affected by environmental limitations because
they are dominated by generalist species, while older metacommunities are
probably affected in different ways in the centre of the distribution, at the
edge of ranges and in sink and source communities. Additionally, it is likely
that species with larger ranges of distribution and those that are more
generalists would co-occur with a greater number of other species
[@Dattilo2020SpeDri], while dispersal capacity of competitive species modulate
their aggregation in space and the effect of interactions on their range limits
[@Godsoe2017IntBio].

## Geographical mismatch and data availability

The geographical mismatch between predators and preys have ecological
consequences such as loss of ecosystem functioning and extiction of populations
[@Anderson2016SpaDis; @Dattilo2018EcoNet; @Pringle2016LarHer; @Young2013EffMam].
Climate change is one of the causes of this, leading, for instance, to the
decrease of plants populations due to lack of pollination [@Bullock2000GeoSep; 
@Afkhami2014MutEff; @Godsoe2017IntBio].
However, this mismatch can also be purely informational. When the distribution
of predators and preys do not superpose, it can mean we lack information about
the distribution of either species or about their interactions. Here we address
part of this problem by comparing the IUCN range maps with GBIF occurrences,
which helped us clarify what is the shortfall for each species. 

The lack of superposition between IUCN range maps and GBIF occurrences suggests
that we certainly do miss geographical information about the distribution of a
certain species, but it is not an indicative about the completeness of the
information about ecological interactions. However, if both GBIF and IUCN
occurrences tend to superpose and still the species is locally removed, this
indicates we don't have information about all its interactions. The combination
of this rationale with our method of updating range maps based on ecological
interactions allows us to have a clearer idea of which information we are
missing. For example, the lion (*Panthera leo*) was one of the species with the
smallest difference between the original and the updated ranges
(@fig:degree), but 59.5% of the GBIF occurrences for this species fell
outside the IUCN range (@fig:gbif). The fact that we don't find lions where it
doesn't have a prey is a good indicative that the IUCN range maps are a good
representation of their distribution, but the high disagreement between the 
IUCN and the GBIF databases adds uncertainty to this statement. On the other
hand, *Leptailurus serval* and *Canis mesomelas* are two of the three species
that lose the higher proportion of range due to the lack of paths to a herbivore
(@fig:degree), but are also some of the species with the higher proportion
of GBIF occurrences inside IUCN range maps (@fig:gbif). This indicates that
the information we are missing for these two species is probably their ecological
interactions. Finally, the extreme case of *Canis aureus* illustrates a lack of
both geographical and ecological information: none of its GBIF occurrences and
none of its preys occur inside its IUCN range. We believe, therefore, that
the validation of species distribution based on ecological interaction is a
relevant method that can further clarify information shortfalls.

## Next steps

Here we demonstrate how we can detect uncertainty in species distribution data
using ecological interactions. Knowing where questionable occurrence data is can
be crucial in ecological modelling [@Hortal2008UncMea; @Ladle2013MapSpe], and
accounting for these errors can improve model outputs by diminishing the error
propation [@Draper1995AssPro]. For instance, we believe this is a way to account
for ecological interactions in habitat suitability models without making the
models more complex, but making sure (not assuming) that the input data - the
species occurrence - actually accounts for ecological interactions. It is
important to notice, however, that the quality and usefulness of this method is
highly correlated with the amount and quality of data available about species'
occurrences **and** interactions. With this paper we hope to add to the collective 
effort to decode the encrypted message that is the occurrence of a species in 
space and time. A promising avenue that adds to our method is the prediction
of networks and interactions in large scale [@Strydom2021RoaPre], for they
can add valuable information about ecological interactions where they are missing.
Additionally, in order to achieve a robust
modelling framework towards actual species distribution models we should invest
in efforts to collect and combine open data on species occurrence and
interactions, especially because we may have been losing ecological interactions
at least as fast as we are losing biodiversity [@Parejo2016InfMis].
