# Intro

The connection between species can be given by antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, which leads to the formation of complex networks that shape ecological structures and maintain the essential functions of ecosystems. These functions include seed dispersal, pollination, biological control, among others. (Albrecht et al., 2018) Plant-herbivore networks are spatiotemporally dynamic, and can be affected by several factors like seasonality, disturbance, specific attributes of species; this highlights the importance of understanding patterns in plant-herbivore ecological networks (Dáttilo & Rico-Gray, 2018).  Studies have reported changes in predator density and diversity along plant diversity gradients, and any change in consumer communities may be a mechanistic cause of changes in predation rates. (Hertzog et al., 2017) 


Possibility that the effects of the species richness of one trophic level on others decrease with trophic distance (?)

# Methods

Serengeti paper - species list and interactions
IUCN range maps
- Why we removed plants from everything
Remove predators where there’s no prey available
The beta-diversity metrics
The GBIF comparison

# Results

Fig 01 - probably the species richness before and after?

# Discussion

Some questions that’d be interesting to answer!!!!!
- Can we SDM one of the species with the updated rangemaps?
- Which rangemaps are the most accurate? 
  - We SDM species from inference data and check which rangemaps (original or updated) are more similar to that 
    - Might bring more questions about which data we’re missing (occurrence or links)
- What does a 0 value on beta-diversity mean? Why does it matter? 
  - Is it the data??????!!!?!?! WHO’S WRONG?!?!?!?
- Can GBIF help us identify if the things we observe is a matter of data or ecology?
- The follow-up paper "Spatial Robustness of networks" by Norma & Fredric
